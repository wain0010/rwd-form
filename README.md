#Hotel-O-City RoomFinder
###Responsive Web Design Form
============


##Description
This site/web application was designed to help people find quality hotel rooms at affordable prices, without having to hunt down online deals manually. The user gives us their information and the RoomFinder searches the web for them, returning results that related to their form data. Results will vary based on user inputs in each field of the form.

##Instructions
The Hotel-O-City RoomFinder is quite easy to use and understand. Simply fill in your hotel/travelling preferences, and let us do the rest!

Here is a step-by-step guide on how to use the RoomFinder:

1. Using a web browser of your choosing (Google Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer, etc.) navigate to the [RoomFinder Web App](http://wain0010.github.io/rwd-form/index.html "Go To RoomFinder")

2. Once the page loads, you'll the Hotel-O-City logo banner, as well as a few form fields to fill out. To get started, choose both your Departure City and Destination City. 

3. Next is your desired Date of Departure and Date of Return. How long do you want your trip to be?

4. We're almost done now. Next use the arrow keys or the arrow icons to count the number of people (Adults) that will be staying at the hotel(s).

5. Finally, how much do you want your stay to cost you? Use the slider button to pick your maximum price in Canadian dollars.

6. Now, click the "Submit" button and let the RoomFinder do its job!

##Notes

*This web site was created for purely aesthetic purposes; the "Submit" button does not actually search hotel room databases and does not actually return data matching the users request. It was simply an assignment for practicing responsive web development while working with HTML5 forms.*
